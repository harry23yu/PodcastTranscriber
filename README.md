# Spotify Transcription Tool

A browser-based tool for transcribing Spotify podcast episodes using [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) for speech-to-text and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) (optional) to remove baked-in ads from transcripts.

## 🚀 Features
- Transcribe any **non-exclusive** Spotify episode
- Optional profanity filter and timestamps
- Download clean, structured transcripts as PDF
- No backend setup required — just paste in your API keys

## 🛠️ Usage

You’ll need:
