How to use Postman to test Transcription:

1. Find if the podcast is Spotify only.
    a. Endpoint: POST https://mutual-platypus-gentle.ngrok-free.app/resolve-episode
    b. Request body: "spotifyUrl": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/EPISODE_ID"

If the podcast is NOT Spotify only, proceed to step 2.

2. Get the transcription ID.
    a. Endpoint: POST https://mutual-platypus-gentle.ngrok-free.app/transcribe
    b. Request body: "audioUrl": "PASTE_AUDIO_URL_HERE"

3. Get the transcription.
    a. Endpoint: GET https://mutual-platypus-gentle.ngrok-free.app/transcribe/TRANSCRIPTION_ID
    b. Request body: "audioUrl": "PASTE_AUDIO_URL_HERE"
    c. If Postman doesn't give you the transcription right away, keep clicking "Send" once every 5-10 seconds and it will eventually give you the transcription.

4. Get the transcription, except this time, the JSON is much cleaner.
    a. Endpoint: GET https://mutual-platypus-gentle.ngrok-free.app/transcribe/summary/TRANSCRIPTION_ID
    b. Request body: "audioUrl": "PASTE_AUDIO_URL_HERE"
